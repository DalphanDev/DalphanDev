### Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Dalphan.

- I'm currently studying **Computer Science** at FAU. (Transferred from UCF)
- Fullstack developer for **AquaCG and DalphanAIO**
- Interested in **Cybersecurity** and **Software Development**
- I first started development on DalphanAIO as a way to teach myself how software is built, and ended up deciding to pursue it and see how much I can build it up.
